# Model selection using RhINNs
This project is currently submitted to Rheologica Acta and is currently under review. The work is titled "Data-driven selection of constitutive models via Rheology-informed Neural Networks (RhINNs)."

This is a Pythonic implementation of a neural network platform that will select the best constitutive model for a given set of data. In this case, nine (9) constitutive models for describing the shear stress of a material versus the imposed shear rate are added to this library, and the platform is tested for each set of data.
